# Flexible Engine landingzone Accelerator

**Landing Zones** refers to the pre-configured and secure cloud environments that organizations use to host their applications and workloads. A **landing zone** is essentially the foundation of a cloud architecture that provides a framework for deploying and managing resources in a secure, scalable, and compliant manner.

This repository contains the Terraform code and related resources necessary to deploy a Landing Zone in **Flexible Engine**.

## Prerequisites
Before you can deploy the Landing Zone in FE, you'll need to have the following:

- A FE account
- Terraform installation

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following resources:

- docs/ - Documentation for setting up and managing a **Landing Zone** in **FE**.
- terraform/
   - modules/ - Terraform modules of landing zone components
   - config/ - Main landing zone terraform code
   - scenario/ - Networking landing zone scenarios
- scripts/ - Python and Bash scripts

## Deployment
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FlexibleEngineCloud/FE-landingzone.git
```

Projects must be created manually and update **projects.json** with project names and IDs already created.
```
{
    "eu-west-0": "PROJECT ID HERE",
    "eu-west-0_Shared_Services": "PROJECT ID HERE",
    "eu-west-0_Dev": "PROJECT ID HERE",
    "eu-west-0_PreProd": "PROJECT ID HERE",
    "eu-west-0_Prod": "PROJECT ID HERE"
}
```

After setting authentication credentials, it could be either, **username/password, AK/SK, Token**.
You should be able to provision resources on your **Flexible Engine domain**.
<br/>
See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/FlexibleEngineCloud/FE-landingzone/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for best practices managing terraform secrets.
<br/>
<br/>
**secrets.tfvars**:
```
ak="ACCESS KEY HERE"
sk="SECRET KEY HERE"
```

You should also adapt groups.json to your IAM hierarchy:
```
This JSON file defines various user groups with associated project permissions and users, such as super_admin, domain_admin, network_admin, and security_admin, dev_admin, preprod_admin, prod_admin. 
User IDs could be retrieved from FE Console -> IAM -> users.
```
<br/>

**tms-tags.json** This JSON data represents a set of key-value pairs describing cloud tags related to environments, applications, regions, availability zones, components, confidentiality levels, creators, data classifications, and departments:

```
[
  {
    "key": "Environment",
    "value": "development"
  },
  {
    "key": "Environment",
    "value": "preproduction"
  },
  {
    "key": "Environment",
    "value": "production"
  },
  ...etc
]
```

**vars.tf** and **terraform.tfvars** also need to be adapted, to match your landing zone requirements.

```
variable "ak" {
  type        = string
  description = "The access key of the FlexibleEngine cloud"
  sensitive   = true
}
variable "sk" {
  type        = string
  description = "The secret key of the FlexibleEngine cloud"
  sensitive   = true
}
variable "domain_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Name of the Domain to scope to"
}
variable "domain_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The ID of the Domain to scope to"
}
variable "tenant_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Name of the Project to login with"
}
variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "Region of the FlexibleEngine cloud"
  default     = "eu-west-0"
}
...etc
```

In a terminal, go into the scenario that fits your requirements, and run the **terraform init** command:

```
$ terraform init -var-file="/path/to/secrets.tfvars"

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Now, run the **terraform plan** command:
```
$ terraform plan -var-file="/path/to/secrets.tfvars"
Terraform will perform the following actions:
...
```
The plan command lets you see what Terraform will do before actually making any changes.
To actually provision the resources, run the terraform apply command:
```
$ terraform apply -var-file="/path/to/secrets.tfvars"
Terraform will perform the following actions:
...
```
Tap **"yes"**, to confirm.
```
Apply complete! Resources: 172 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
Congrats, youâ€™ve just deployed a landing zone in your FlexibleEngine account using Terraform! To verify this, head over to the FlexibleEngine console, and you should see your awesome infrastructure ready to go.
