# FlexibleEngine landingzone Accelerator

Landing Zones refers to the pre-configured and secure cloud environments that organizations use to host their applications and workloads. A landing zone is essentially the foundation of a cloud architecture that provides a framework for deploying and managing resources in a secure, scalable, and compliant manner.

This repository contains the Terraform code and related resources necessary to deploy a Landing Zone in FlexibleEngine.

## Prerequisites
Before you can deploy the Landing Zone in FE, you'll need to have the following:

- A FE account
- Terraform installation

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following resources:

- docs/ - Documentation for setting up and managing a Landing Zone in FE.
- terraform/ - Terraform modules for creating a Landing Zone in FE.

## Deployment
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FlexibleEngineCloud/FE-landingzone.git
```
After setting authentication method credentials, it could be either, username/password, AK/SK, Token.
You should be able to provision resources on your FlexibleEngine domain.

See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/FlexibleEngineCloud/FE-landingzone/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for best practices managing terraform secrets.

In a terminal, go into the scenario that fits your requirements, and run the terraform init command:
```
$ terraform init

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```
Now, run the terraform plan command:
```
$ terraform plan
Terraform will perform the following actions:
...
```
The plan command lets you see what Terraform will do before actually making any changes.
To actually provision the resources, run the terraform apply command:
```
$ terraform apply
Terraform will perform the following actions:
...
```
Tap "yes", to confirm.
```
Apply complete! Resources: 18 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
Congrats, youâ€™ve just deployed a landing zone in your FlexibleEngine account using Terraform! To verify this, head over to the FlexibleEngine console, and you should see your awesome infrastructure ready to go.
